Why use linked list?
- grow and shrink collection with ease
- space doesn't have to be continuous 

Tradeoff
- linked list doesnt have indicies (arr[i])

In C++, you need to provide a location in memory for each variable


when you push el to arr, that's constant time but some take o(n) ---> this is rare
